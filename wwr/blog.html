</div>
<p>According to historians, rafting was discovered by the American soldier, geologist, botanist, and explorer John Wesley Powel in 1869. Powel became famous for having organized the first expedition in boats with a central oar on the Colorado River in the United States.  The beginners in the sport did not have many techniques to steer the boats, as rigid and heavy as they were at that time, so they overturned them and even hit natural rocks. 

    The year 1842 marked the beginning of modern rafting history. The engineer, botanist and politician Lieutenant John Fremont made his first trips using a boat designed by Horace H. Day, an American painter of the time. With few resources, the boat was built with four separate cabins, made of Indian cloth and rubber. Unlike other boats, it had a flat bottom and a rectangular shape. This boat was called the Air Army Boats.
    
   
    
    </p>
<p> Nathaniel Galloway transformed rafting techniques. Galloway made a simple change, but it came in handy: he put the front seat of the boat facing forward. This substitution helped the adventurers pass through the natural obstacles in the rapids, as well as assisting in the execution of the maneuvers. Rafting rose after World War I and World War II, when rubber dinghies were brought in by the American army in order to use them as life rafts. 
    
    The year 1950 was a good year, as the equipment began to be improved, and new routes were explored. This attracted river enthusiasts to rafting, giving the sport greater visibility. The year 1960 leveraged even more the modality, since new boats were produced. 
    
    On the other hand, 1972 was not so beneficial. The sport went through a period without much news. The 80's improved again due to the invention of the self bailer, a dinghy with a hollow bottom, produced by Vladimir Kovalik, Rafael Gallo, the Metzler company from Germany, etc. </p>

<p>For the safe accomplishment of the sports, as well as other modalities, some equipment is necessary. In the case of rafting, the boat used must be in accordance with the team's objectives, as well as the number of participants, because each boat has distinct attributes. 

    The boats are produced from a resistant material, hypalon, a fabric that mixes polyester fiber and neoprene. The size ranges from 3.65m to 5.50m. According to the practitioners, the larger the boat, the better the stability during the trip.
    
    The use of oars is also very important. They need to be light, easy to handle, made of a firm plastic material, and the handles made of aluminum.
    </p>
<p>The vests need to be suitable for activities in rivers with currents. They allow good buoyancy and body protection for the situations experienced in rafting. 

    Another essential object for the practice of the sport is the helmet.  It must be light and firm to ensure adequate protection in case of a collision with the rocks. It is also necessary that it has internal adjustment to accommodate the different sizes of the head of each practitioner.
    
    The waterproof bag is another essential item. These are small waterproof bags suitable for carrying first aid items, pieces of fabric for the dinghy if necessary, cameras, as well as other clothing, water, snacks, etc.</p>

</div>
<p>

    -Level I: areas with small stones. This level requires rare maneuvers.
    -Level II: at this level the waters are more active. There may be a few rocks in the route, which requires the exercise of some maneuvers.
    -Level III: it has small waves and a small waterfall. This level exposes you to great risks. It also requires some maneuvering skills.
    
    </p>
<p>-Level IV: This level has medium waves, few rocks, and large waterfalls. The maneuvers are more complex.
    -Level V: At this level the waves, rocks, and falls are large. It involves greater risks, requiring precise maneuvers.
    -Level VI: Very dangerous rapids. At this level there are rocks and large waves. With the great friction with the water there may be damage to the dinghy.
    -Level VII: The most dangerous level of all, because there is the risk of seriously injuring the practitioners, besides leading them to death. To accomplish this path one needs a lot of skill and knowledge of the techniques.</p>

<p>In Brazil, rafting began to be practiced in the 1980s. The first boats for rapids appeared in the country in 1982, through TY-Y Expedições, the first Brazilian company specialized in the sport, which operated in the rivers Paraíba do Sul and Paraibuna, in Rio de Janeiro. The 1980's was a time when the sport was not so lively in the country, for all the programs were designed to receive foreign tourists who came to Rio de Janeiro on vacation.

    The sport began to gain more notoriety with the first specialized rafting company in Brazil, Canoar Rafting e Expedições, at the end of the 1990s. The company brought the sport with individual oars, an important innovation for Brazilian rafting.
