    <p>I'm Marco. I'm marriage father of litte girl of 7 years old and like to build awesome stuff using new techologies and tools. I really like the magic power building web applications.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is Enos 1:4 "4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, 
        and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens."</p>
